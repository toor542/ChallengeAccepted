QUESTION 1:

a.) 	What went wrong is when you guys were evaluating the Average Order Value (AOV) you considered the total 
	number of order ids (5000) for calculating the AOV. You simply took the number of rows through order Id, 
	whereas you forgot that each row has a different number of ordered products.
	So for each purchase you just considered selling of one product.
	You should have used the total number of items for all orders instead of total number of orders.
	So you used the formula as : ( sum total of order_amount ) / ( count of order ids )

	A better approach for this would be to use the total amount each order had and then use it for evaluating the AOV.
	Thus the formula should be : ( sum total of order_amount ) / ( sum of total items )

b.) 	So the metric to be used should be to divide the total revenue, which is total of order amount, by
	the sum of total items.
	
		AOV = ( sum total of order_amount ) / ( sum of total items )

c.) 	When we put the respective values we get,
	sum total of order_amount = 15725640
	sum of total items = 43936
	
	Thus,
		AOV = 15725640 / 43936
		
		AOV = 357.92
